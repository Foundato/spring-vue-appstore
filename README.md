```

2. Set environment vairables for running PostgreSQL instance
```bash
export JDBC_DATABASE_URL=<your url>
export JDBC_DATABASE_USERNAME=<your user>
export JDBC_DATABASE_PASSWORD=<your password>

# Integrate with kelon
export OPA_URL=<url to opa>
```

3. Start Spring via maven
```bash
# Production mode
mvn spring-boot:run -Pprod

# Local development (H2 database is used)
mvn spring-boot:run -Pdev
```
